    <h2>🌍 The Vision Behind ADA</h2>
    <p>
      ADA (Artificial Domestic Assistant) is more than just a tool – it's a declaration of independence from surveillance-based smart systems.
      While big tech turns your voice into profit, ADA stays silent about you – by design.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our mission is to create a smart assistant that lives in your home, not in the cloud. One that doesn't analyze your voice, track your commands, or monetize your life.
      You are the owner. You are in control. Always.

    <h2>🔐 Why Privacy Matters More Than Ever</h2>
    <p>
      Every day, smart devices record, analyze and upload millions of private conversations. Most users have no idea how far this goes – or who listens.
      ADA is a response to this imbalance.

    <p>
    ADA is currently in <strong>active development</strong>. While the core is functional and runs fully offline, we are working on:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>A plugin system for smart devices</li>
      <li>A visual smart mirror interface</li>
      <li>A secure update system (optional, with full user control)</li>
      <li>Routine builder for automations (morning/night flows)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Source code will be available after version 1.0 –</strong> current builds contain private and personal configurations.

    <h2>🤝 Credits & Inspiration</h2>
    <p>
      ADA is inspired by projects like <strong>Mycroft</strong>, <strong>Home Assistant</strong>, and the commitment to privacy from companies like <strong>Proton</strong> and the <strong>EFF</strong>.
      The name ADA is a tribute to both the AI from the game <em>Satisfactory</em> and the legendary <strong>Ada Lovelace</strong>.
